# SkinnyAdmin

Easily create an admin interface in Rails.  Unlike other administrative frameworks, Skinny Admin is meant
to be a quick way to setup your Administrative needs and allow you to work within Ruby/Rails with
no strange DSLs.  This will allow you to use what you already know and reduce startup time.

Please see the Documentation and take the Test Drive at [SkinnyAdmin.org](http://skinnyadmin.orgy)
